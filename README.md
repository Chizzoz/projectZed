A webpage showing a list of projects done by Zambian Developers. A great place to find Zambian Developer works and contribute to Zambian Open Source projects.

I am looking for anyone that would like to help contribute to this page. Just raise an issue if you want to suggest something to be added to the site.

If you are Zambian and have a project you would like on the page just hit me a message on twitter( @MulengaWilfred)
